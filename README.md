The goal of this project is to deconstruct a web page and rebuild it. This should help me find out what elements go where and how I can manipulate them to suit my needs.
Rebuilding a simple web site should help hammer in some of the basic of Front-end web development.


This project ended up taking me WAY too long. When I got about 70% done with it I ended up getting COVID from a roommate. After I recovered (except for my sense of smell) I got lazy about working on it again.
I eventually sat myself in front of the computer to finish the Google homepage project.
